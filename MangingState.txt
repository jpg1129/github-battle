The Component Lifecycle 

You can break down the lifecycle into three parts.
1.) When the component gets added to the DOM (mounting)
2.) When the component updates its state or receives new data via props (updating)
3.) When the component gets removed from the DOM (unmounting).

Initial State (constructor)

DOM Node (render lifecyle method to decide )

 Though you're not exactly rendering a DOM node yourself, 
 you'll use the render lifecycle method in order to describe 
 (using JSX) the type of DOM node you want to render.

  It's important that render is a pure function. 
  It shouldn't do anything other than examine the component's state and p
  rops and return a description of the UI

Ajax Requests (componentDidMount)

Updating 
  Re-render the UI with the updated state or props  (React handles this)
  Re-fetching data (ComponentDidUpdate)
  Re-setting listener (ComponentDidUpdate)

unmounting
  cleanup, remove listeners, etc..
